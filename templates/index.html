					<h2>eAbsentee Advocacy</h2>
				</header>

				<p>Our organization aims to make it easier for Virginia voters to vote
					by absentee ballot. In the upcoming Virginia legislative session, many
					bills have been pre-filed to do that. Some need your support right
					now. The bills include:</p>

				<p>
					<b><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1">HB 1: No-excuse absentee voting</a></b>
					- Del. Herring’s bill removes the requirements to vote absentee, allowing
					any voter to request an absentee ballot, and simplifying the absentee
					ballot request form. Click <a href="./hb1">here</a> to send an email to your legislator
					supporting it.
					</br>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&typ=bil&val=HB220">HB 220: Prepaid postage for absentee ballots</a></b>
					- Del. Krizek’s bill eliminates a barrier-to-voting, particularly among
					syounger people that don’t keep stamps in their drawer. Click
					<a href="./hb220">here</a> to send an email to your legislator
					supporting it.
					</br>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&typ=bil&val=HB207">HB 207: Apply once to receive an absentee ballot for each election (“permanent absentee”)</a></b>
					- Del. VanValkenburg’s bill allows a voter to choose to vote-at-home
					in each election, rather than sending in an application for each and
				 every election. Click <a href="./hb207">here</a> to send an email to your legislator
					supporting it.
					</br>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB238">HB 238: Extended deadline for absentee ballot return</a></b>
					- Del. Sickles’ bill ensures that any valid absentee ballot postmarked
					 on or before Election Day and received by the registrar within three
					 days of the election will be counted, thus making sure more absentee
					 ballots will be counted Click <a href="./hb238">here</a> to send an
					 email to your legislator supporting it.
					</br>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB201">HB 201: Same-day registration</a></b>
					 - Del. Ayala’s bill allows any eligible voter to register to vote on
					 the day that they desire to vote for in-person absentee (early) voting

						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						<b>How does COVID-19 affect elections?</b>
						<br>
						Because of COVID-19, all voters are now eligible to apply for absentee ballots in the May town elections
						using Reason 2A: "I have a disability or illness.". We are working with election officials to provide
						further guidance on the June congressional primary elections.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>How does this site work?</b>
						<br>
						It places the information you enter onto an official Virginia form, creates a PDF and emails an
						electronically signed copy to your county/city registrar. You can receive a copy of the PDF if you
						provide your email address.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>The form needs to be signed. Is the electronic signature here adequate?</b>
						<br>
						Yes. According to a decision by the Virginia State Board of Elections made in 2015 at the
						request of Speaker Bill Howell, registrars can accept emailed applications with such signatures.
						For more details and news articles on the topic, click <a href="/about/">here</a>.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>Can anyone receive an absentee ballot?</b>
						<br>
						By Virginia law, a voter needs to provide one of 20 reasons, such as being
						physically present outside of the County/City where you are registered on Election Day, to
						qualify for an absentee ballot.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>How long will it take to receive an absentee ballot?</b>
						<br>
						Typically within 10 business days.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>What if I don’t receive my absentee ballot?</b>
						<br>
						Call your local General Registrar, the Virginia Department of Elections toll free number or check
						the Department of Elections website: <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/">elections.virginia.gov</a>.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>Can I submit this application on behalf of someone else?</b>
						<br>
						No. It’s acceptable to help someone fill it out data fields, but the voter must give final approval
						for submission.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>What if I get an absentee ballot, then later decide to vote in person? Or what if I forget I
							submitted an absentee and show up at the polling place?</b>
						<br>
						The registrar keeps good records of these things. If you show up at the polls after having
						received an absentee ballot, you can either bring your ballot and surrender it at your poll on
						Election Day or you may be asked to cast a provisional ballot. Your vote will not be counted
						twice.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>Is there a risk of voter fraud here?</b>
						<br>
						This website only submits applications for absentee ballots. It does not cast ballots themselves.
						If a voter receives an absentee ballot without wanting it, he/she can surrender it at a polling
						place or cast a provisional ballot. Plus, falsely requesting an absentee ballot is a felony, just like
						with a traditional paper application, except here it is traceable on-line unlike mailed in absentee
						ballot applications.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>Who sponsors this website?</b>
						<br>
						It is run by Vote Absentee Virginia, a not-for-profit 501(c)4 organization. It was formed to help broaden
						voter access across all parties in Virginia. Click <a href="/about">here</a> for more information.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>How do you make money here?</b>
						<br>
						We don’t. We created this site as a public service to Virginians.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>Does the state of Virginia have its own website to request absentee ballots?</b>
						<br id="faq_ssn">
						It does, but it asks for a lot more information like driver’s license number and full social security
						number. That can be daunting, particularly for people who don’t have driver’s licenses.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<section>
						<p>
							<b>Where does my data go?</b>

							<p>It goes to two places and partly to a third. The two: your local County/City registrar and this
								website’s sponsor, Vote Absentee Virginia. </p>
							<p> At the end of each day, this website destroys its records of the last-four-digits of your Social
								Security number from its records. The end-of-the-day gives us enough time to ensure your
								application PDF was properly sent, then afterwards we don’t need—or really even want—those
								last four digits. </p>
							<p> The third place your data goes: if you landed on this site from a link sent by an organization,
								then it receives your name and contact information (but not your last-four-of-SSN nor reason-
								for-absentee-voting). </p>
							<p> Which organization? At the end of the url link you clicked is a set of letters. In most cases, the
								organization will be apparent. However, if you are unsure, email the letter-code to
								raunak@eAbsentee.org and we’ll be happy to let you know, usually a candidate’s campaign or
								get-out-the-vote group.
							</p>
							<p> Why is partial information provided to linking organizations? Campaigns and get-out-the-vote groups
								work hard to reach out potential voters. They want to know which channels are making an impact, plus
								they want to encourage you afterwards to return your absentee ballot. Your data will never be sold by Vote Absentee Virginia. (See <a href="/about">"About Us”</a> for detail on how the site is supported).
							</p>
						</p>
					</section>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>How can I check whether my absentee application is in process?</b>
						<br>
						A voter can check his or here voter record, including applications, at the <a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation"> Virginia elections website.</a>
						Please allow a few days for the local registrar to enter an application into the computer system.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						<b>On the website application form, I don't see my county/city on the dropdown list? Where is it?</b>
						<br>
						Some campaign-specific links to the eAbsentee website limit the choices for county/city. You may have clicked on such a link. To see all county/cities, clear the cookies from your browser (usually in the same place you clear history).
						Note: this won't work for Chrome, so a different browser should be used to solve this problem.
