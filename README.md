# eAbsentee: Absentee Ballot Request System

A web app built with Flask which allows users to submit applications for absentee ballots in the state of Virginia. Somebody who wants an absentee ballot can complete a web form, and eAbsentee will use their input to complete the state-sanctioned PDF and email it to the state registrar of their locality. eAbsentee is based off of and expands upon [Horatio](https://github.com/TrustTheVote-Project/horatio-client), the original online absentee ballot application.

Absentee ballot request forms may be submitted electronically in Virginia under the authority of [attorney general opinion #13-111](http://ag.virginia.gov/files/Opinions/2014/13-111_Hinshaw.pdf) and [approval of the State Board of Elections](https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting\151\22788\Minutes_SBE_22788_v2.pdf). (p. 7, lines 189â€“215).
