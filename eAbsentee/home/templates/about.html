<div class="container">
  <p>
    &emsp;eAbsentee was created to allow voters to apply for an absentee ballot with ease. eAbsentee is sponsored by Vote Absentee Virginia, a not-for-profit organization based in Falls Church, VA. Vote Absentee Virginia was formed to
    help
    broaden voter access across all parties in Virginia. It does not generate revenue from this site; its only source of revenue is civic-minded donors who believe that mailed-out ballots help increase voter participation in our democracy.

    &emsp;On May 13, 2015, the Virginia State Board of Elections approved Republican Speaker Bill Howell's request to authorize the acceptance of electronically-signed absentee ballot applications. His primary challenger sued the State Board of Elections and was rejected by the Stafford County Circuit Court before the June primary date. On July 1, 2015, Innovate Virginia PAC made an electronic ballot application available to all Virginians. The Republican Party of Virginia posted their own portal later in the summer and later that Fall, the Virginia Department of Elections posted an official portal on the state website. Over the last four years, several different organizations created their own portals, including Vote Absentee Virginia.

After my colleagues and I started eAbsentee in 2015, I asked my friends at the non-profit Vote Absentee Virginia to take eAbsentee to another level. They did. It has helped thousands of Virginia voters apply easily for absentee ballots and has helped dozens of get-out-the-vote organizations to mobilize voters."</span>
