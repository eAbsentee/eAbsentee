      <h1> About Us </h1>
      <p>This website is sponsored by Vote Absentee Virginia, a not-for-profit 501(c)4 organization based in
        Falls Church, VA. It was formed to help broaden voter access across all parties in Virginia. It does
        not generate revenue from this site; its only source of revenue is civic-minded donors who
        believe that mailed-out ballots help increase voter participation in our democracy.</p>

          eAbsentee was created to allow voters to apply for an absentee ballot with ease. More information about us can be found <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/one-vote-can-change-everything-virginia/2019/11/04/86deb89e-ff26-11e9-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html"> here </a>.

          <h2>About Electronically Signed Absentee Ballots</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          On May 13, 2015, the Virginia State Board of Elections approved Republican Speaker Bill Howell's request to authorize the acceptance of electronically-signed absentee ballot applications. His primary challenger sued the State Board of Elections and was rejected by the Stafford County Circuit Court before the June primary date. On July 1, 2015, Innovate Virginia PAC made an electronic ballot application available to all Virginians. The Republican Party of Virginia posted their own portal later in the summer and later that Fall, the Virginia Department of Elections posted an official portal on the state website. Over the last four years, several different organizations created their own portals, including Vote Absentee Virginia. </p>
